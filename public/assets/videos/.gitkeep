# Videos Folder

This folder is for storing video files used in the application.

## Usage
- Place your video files (mp4, webm, etc.) in this folder
- Reference them in components using `/assets/videos/filename.mp4`
- Recommended formats: MP4, WebM for cross-browser compatibility

## Example
```jsx
<source src="/assets/videos/demo-video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
```

## File Naming Convention
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `product-demo.mp4`
- Keep file sizes optimized for web (under 10MB recommended)
- Provide multiple formats when possible for better compatibility
